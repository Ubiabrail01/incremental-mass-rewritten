TO-DO LIST:
1: Remaining mechanics:
	1a. Quantum Foam:
		Connectable products?
	1b. Spectra Generators:
		You get Spectra Generators by fusing from Quantum Foam resources.
		Spectra Generators generate Chroma which is used to mix for both kinds from Chroma Tree.
		Spectra Generators boost stuff by upgrades, and boosted by Exotic Matter.
	1c. Blueprint - Primordium:
		Coding with groups.
	1d. ???:
		Mirror Mechanic?
2: Strange layer or a new game?
	(Maybe called Hex, the High Ranked)
	(or Strange, the Strangely Matter?)
	(or Lightning / Cloudy)
3: Upgrades
	3a. [Axion?] RP base formula is better. [^b^11/60, decay]
	3b. [Future] Multiply Particle Powers based on original formula.
	3c. [Future] Collapsed Stars add Cosmic Rays.
	3d. [Rank]   Argon-18 boosts Tickspeed Power instead.
	3e. [Future] Mass multiplies their softcaps by ^x.
	3f. [Future] Add Neutron Condensers.
4: A formula which gives a bit of linear inflation, but decays in a logarithmically rate.
	(b^(x/log(x/n+1)) or x^(k/log(log(x)/n+1)+1), where n is a upgrade factor)
