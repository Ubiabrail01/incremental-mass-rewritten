TO-DO LIST:
1: Remaining mechanics:
	1a. Quantum Foam:
		Connectable products?
	1b. Spectra Generators:
		You get Spectra Generators by fusing from Quantum Foam resources.
		Spectra Generators generate Chroma which is used to mix for both kinds from Chroma Tree.
		Spectra Generators boost stuff by upgrades, and boosted by Exotic Matter.
	1c. Blueprint - Primordium:
		Coding with groups.
	1d. ???:
		Mirror Mechanic?
2: Zeta layer, Metaphysics from Chakra's gifts.
	2a. Fluid
	2b. Imaginary
	2c. Mirror
	2d. Strange
	2e. Muonic
3: Upgrades
	3a-i. RP base formula is better. [^b^11/60, decay]
	3a-ii. Or reduce both MD6 effect and softcap. [decay]
	3b. Remove softcaps of MD Upgrades, and MD11 - 12.
	3c. Multiply Particle Powers based on original formula.
	3d. Add Neutron Condensers.
4: A formula which gives a bit of linear inflation, but decays in a logarithmically rate.
	(b^(x/log(x/n+1)) or x^(k/log(log(x)/n+1)+1), where n is a upgrade factor)
