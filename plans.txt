TO-DO LIST:
1: Remaining mechanics:
	1c. Quantum Foam:
		Connectable products?
	1d. Spectra Generators:
		You get Spectra Generators by fusing from Quantum Foam resources.
		Spectra Generators generate Chroma which is used to mix for both kinds from Chroma Tree.
		Spectra Generators boost stuff by upgrades, and boosted by Exotic Matter.
2: Another new layer: Strange
	2a. Blueprint:
		Coding with groups.
	2b. Primordium:
		???
	2c. ???:
		Mirror Mechanic?
3: Another Post-Strange layer or a new game?
	(Maybe called Hex, the High Ranked)
	(or Strange, the Strangely Matter?)
	(or Lightning / Cloudy)

B1 (upgrades):
1. [???]         Reduce MD Upgrade 6 softcap.
2. [C14 Reward]  Raise C10 reward exponent. (from ^1/1.75 to ^1)
3. [Chromaspice] Dilated mass raises tickspeed.
4. [???]         Add Atom Upgrade 9 effect. (+6.21% max)
5. [Scrapped]    Stronger directly adds itself. (x^1.5 / 100)
6. [Chromaspice] Tickspeed Power multiplies Stronger.
7. [Axion]       Tickspeed Power raises BH Condenser Power.

B2: A formula which gives a bit of linear inflation, but decays in a logarithmically rate.
	(b^(x/log(x/n+1)) or x^(k/log(log(x)/n+1)+1), where n is a upgrade factor)
